I‚Äôm always on the lookout for the perfect composition!
In photography, I‚Äôm not afraid to roll on the ground in front of a bear to get the best shot (though, honestly, it‚Äôs rarely the best shot‚Äîunless you consider the best shot to be the one you get when you dare rolling on the ground in front of a bear).
In robotics, I aim to balance control, electronics, mechanics, and technology to create well-rounded designs.

Two references that sum up my mindset :

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: space-between; gap: 20px; background: #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden;">

  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 20px; background-color: #f0f0f0; box-sizing: border-box; text-align: center">
    <div style="font-size: 80%; display: inline-block; text-align: left">
      <i>‚Äî Yeah, well don‚Äôt do it all in one go, do it in 3 days !</i>
    </div><br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è Marine Robotics: Building Smart Systems, Smartly

What excites me most about robotics is transdisciplinarity: designing mechatronic and algorithmic architecture in symbiosis.

I‚Äôm all about symbiosis at every level :

* Interdisciplinary, for instance, considering propulsion systems based on different actuation principles (swimming by soft robotics, piezoelectric deformation...),
* Inter-algorithmic, like exploring less hierarchical control methods, where planning and navigation are co-constrained (dynamic planning), or trajectory generation that‚Äôs co-constrained with the guidance law (I ask myself a lot of questions about the operations possible with sliding surfaces).

I‚Äôm still a beginner in these areas, but I‚Äôve got 60 years (hopefully) to dive deeper. So, let‚Äôs not do it all in one go, let's do it in 60 years!

## üì∑ Nature Photography: A Personal Journey Above All

I believe in patience and determination. While some may aim to push further and become top-tier freelance photographers, I‚Äôm happy to travel at my own pace, taking my time with my humble entry-level DSLR.
Change my camera? Why bother? This one‚Äôs still working fine! My photos won‚Äôt be the most stunning, nor worthy of the great naturalists. But hey... we can revisit that in 60 years!
