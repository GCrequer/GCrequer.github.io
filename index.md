Iâ€™m always on the lookout for the perfect composition!
In photography, Iâ€™m not afraid to roll on the ground in front of a bear to get the best shot (though, honestly, itâ€™s rarely the best shotâ€”unless you consider the best shot to be the one you get when you dare rolling on the ground in front of a bear).
In robotics, I aim to balance control, electronics, mechanics, and technology to create well-rounded designs.

## â›µ Marine Robotics: Building Smart Systems, Smartly

What excites me most about robotics is transdisciplinarity: designing mechatronic and algorithmic architecture in symbiosis.

Iâ€™m all about symbiosis at every level :

* Interdisciplinary, for instance, considering propulsion systems based on different actuation principles (swimming by soft robotics, piezoelectric deformation...),
* Inter-algorithmic, like exploring less hierarchical control methods, where planning and navigation are co-constrained (dynamic planning), or trajectory generation thatâ€™s co-constrained with the guidance law (I ask myself a lot of questions about the operations possible with sliding surfaces).

Iâ€™m still a beginner in these areas, but Iâ€™ve got 60 years (hopefully) to dive deeper. So, letâ€™s not do it all in one go, let's do it in 60 years!

## ðŸ“· Nature Photography: A Personal Journey Above All

I believe in patience and determination. While some may aim to push further and become top-tier freelance photographers, Iâ€™m happy to travel at my own pace, taking my time with my humble entry-level DSLR.
Change my camera? Why bother? This oneâ€™s still working fine! My photos wonâ€™t be the most stunning, nor worthy of the great naturalists. But hey... we can revisit that in 60 years!
